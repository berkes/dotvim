A Vim client to connect to Xdebug was originally written by Seung Woo Shin <segv <at> sayclub.com>
[remote PHP debugger](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1152)
which was then developed by Sam Ghods <sam <at> box.net>
and renamed [DBGp client](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1929)

In 2009 Hadi Zeftin updated the script to run under 7.1 and added tab support
[DBGp-client](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2508)

And this is Hadi Zeftin's version updated to run using pathogen.vim
